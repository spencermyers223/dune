# Jito - Solana MEV & Liquid Staking Protocol Configuration

name: Jito
chain: solana

  alternatives:
    - dex_solana.bot_trades  # MEV/bot activity
    - tokens.transfers       # JitoSOL transfers

# Important notes
gotchas:
  - "Jito has TWO products: MEV infrastructure AND liquid staking (JitoSOL)"
  - "For MEV data, check dex_solana.bot_trades"
  - "For staking TVL, track JitoSOL token supply/transfers"
  - "JitoSOL mint: J1toso1uCk3RLmjorhTtrVwY9HJ7X8V9yYac6Y7kGCPn"
  - "Jito tips/bundles may not be directly queryable in Dune"
  - "MEV revenue data may require Jito API"

# Potential query approaches
potential_queries:
  bot_activity_overview: |
    -- General MEV/bot activity on Solana (not Jito-specific)
    SELECT
      block_date,
      type AS bot_type,
      SUM(amount_usd) AS volume,
      COUNT(*) AS trades,
      COUNT(DISTINCT bot) AS unique_bots
    FROM dex_solana.bot_trades
    WHERE block_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY
    GROUP BY block_date, type
    ORDER BY block_date DESC, volume DESC

  jitosol_transfers: |
    -- Track JitoSOL token transfers (staking activity proxy)
    SELECT
      block_date,
      COUNT(*) AS transfer_count,
      SUM(amount) AS jitosol_transferred
    FROM tokens.transfers
    WHERE blockchain = 'solana'
      AND contract_address = 'J1toso1uCk3RLmjorhTtrVwY9HJ7X8V9yYac6Y7kGCPn'
      AND block_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
    GROUP BY block_date
    ORDER BY block_date DESC

  jitosol_dex_volume: |
    -- JitoSOL trading volume
    SELECT
      block_date,
      SUM(amount_usd) AS volume,
      COUNT(*) AS trades
    FROM dex_solana.trades
    WHERE (token_bought_symbol = 'JitoSOL' OR token_sold_symbol = 'JitoSOL')
      AND block_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
    GROUP BY block_date
    ORDER BY block_date DESC

  mev_by_type: |
    -- MEV activity breakdown
    SELECT
      type,
      SUM(amount_usd) AS total_volume,
      COUNT(*) AS trade_count,
      AVG(amount_usd) AS avg_trade_size
    FROM dex_solana.bot_trades
    WHERE block_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY
